2. Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
3. Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
4. Display the following on the page:
    - Press any key to get started!
    - Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
    - If the word is muggle, display it like this when the game starts: _ _ _ _ _ _.
    - As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: m u g g _ _.
    - Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
    - Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like L Z Y H).
5. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

The theme for my hangman game is **Harry Potter**! As soon as the page loads, the game is ready to play. The game uses a keyboard event to listen for the letters in the word. All you have to do is guess the letters in the selected word by pressing the letters on your keyboard. If you guess all the letters correctly, you have won the game. If you run out of guesses before guessing the word, you have lost the game. The game will keep track and display your total wins and losses as you go. After each win/loss, the game will automatically select another word for you to continue playing. If you want Harry Potter theme music to play in the background, simply press the 'Play Music' button at the bottom of the screen. You can press it again to pause at any time. A new song will begin playing after each win/loss.
